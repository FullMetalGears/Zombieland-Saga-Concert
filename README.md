Franchouchou was gotten a gig in a new city and their number one fans, The Paycheck Gang show up! 
Alesso is old news! Franchouchou is the new news! From taking over Saga, they are now going worldwide!
This mod will replace most textures and msuic with zombieland Saga! Battle your way pass the undead cops or stealth to the beat!
Enjoy the Alesso heist like you never seen before! No more alesso posters! Just Franchouchou now! Things from tvs to t-shirts are now edited! 
Walk in and see the change for yourself!

This mod features a unique song that plays during the heist! 
There is also the songs available in their own heist tracks as well! When you download one of the zips files just simply drop both the folders to the main folder of PAYDAY 2 and the rest is gold! (will need beardlib and superBLT installed first)
There are two zips to download. One is just the heist retexture + alesso heist music change and heist rename. 
The another is all the stuff before but also includes the Revenge intro and dawn of the bad as heist tracks as well!

What could be better? Some things could have been edited better. 
The alesso music is editted wrongly where a certain chuck of the song won't play when it supposed to or when I think it supposed to but overall the transitions are good. Just when you start the heist, it plays a song file wrongly due to a misedited on my behalf but this issue is only when you start the heist. The control phase music will cut at a bad time since I choose a different song for control phases. 
Some textures are not properly lined up and may clipped out of the texture zone. The popcorn picture texture is hanging and can easily be seened floating if you look at it in a certain spot. And some images are stretch abit and may be in lower quality.

Overall, you should be able to enjoy the mod without almost any issues!
