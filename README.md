What could be better? Some things could have been edited better. 
The alesso music is editted wrongly where a certain chuck of the song won't play when it supposed to or when I think it supposed to but overall the transitions are good. Just when you start the heist, it plays a song file wrongly due to a misedited on my behalf but this issue is only when you start the heist. The control phase music will cut at a bad time since I choose a different song for control phases. 
Some textures are not properly lined up and may clipped out of the texture zone. The popcorn picture texture is hanging and can easily be seened floating if you look at it in a certain spot. And some images are stretch abit and may be in lower quality. Github 100mb limit forcing some files to be spit up.

Overall, you should be able to enjoy the mod without almost any issues!
